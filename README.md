# Balanced-Waterfill

A factorio mod that aims to provide a less broken version of standard waterfill mods. 

# Overview
Other waterfill mods traditionally have the issue that placing water is unrestricted, and let you place water under biters, players, and even biter nests, instantly killing them. This has led to many lost spidertrons to accidental waterfilling, and countless accidents. The ablity to place an indestructible, impassible (except for landfill) baririer will also understandably lead to people making perfect walls, that remove the challenge of biters from the game. This mod rectifes the balance issues with other waterfill mods, by making it impossible to place water under entities, as well as making(only) the water placed by waterfill walkable to both players and biters. These changes make it possible to still use waterfill to build ultra efficient nuclear power plants, and generally lessen the hassle of moving water, while being significantly more vanilla freindly than most other waterfill mods on the market.

# Features

 - The ability to change how much the recipe of waterfill costs to make, from just consuming water, to requiring water to be barreled before making waterfill(this returns the same ammount of empty barrels), to actually consuming barrels, requiring a constant supply of barrels to make waterfill.
 - A setting to make waterfill kill players and biters when placed under them, this does turn waterfill back into the perfect wall, but still makes it impossible to accidentally delete parts of your factory, as well as protecting spidertrons.(This is mainly a feature because it is funny to kill your freinds with waterfill, but destroying spidertrons is never fun)
 - Works with offshore pumps
 - Has a technology unlock

# Notes

 - The "Funny mode" feature only works in versions 1.1.51 and beyond, as it requires a special flag that was added in that version
