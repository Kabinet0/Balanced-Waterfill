# Balanced Waterfill
A Factorio mod that aims to provide a more balanced counterpart to standard waterfill mods.

# Overview

This mod offers a more balanced, and less cheaty waterfill solution. Other waterfill mods allow the placement of regular water anywhere, and can be used to kill players, biters, or even destroy vehicles and parts of the factory. (Due to the lack of restrictions on placement) This mod circumvents the balance issue of being able to destroy anything and create impenetrable walls by only allowing the player to place shallow water, which can be walked on. The mod also prevents you from placing this water under buildings, and cannot be used to destroy them instantly. This behavior is also very configurable, and can be changed based on how "cheaty" the player would prefer the waterfill to be. 

# Features

 - By default prevents building impenetrable walls
 - Keeps the factory, vehicles, players, and biters safe from being deleted by waterfilling. 
 - Biters are slowed by walking on waterfill (Toggleable for ups savings)
 - Offers options to control how expensive it is to produce waterfill, allowing you to set your own difficulty
 - The ability to switch the waterfill texture between shallow water,  and muddy water
 - Fully customizable waterfill properties, allowing the player to control how cheaty the experience should be, including the option to make the waterfill kill players, while still allowing biters to cross it and keeping the factory safe from waterfilling. 
 - Has a technology unlock
 - Functions like normal water, allowing for offshore pumps and absorbing pollution

# Integration With Other Mods

The mod requires some compatibility patches in order to work properly with other mods that modify terrain, or change something relating to the water found in the base game. It should function just fine with most mods however. Below is a list of mods that have been integrated in some way, as well as what was needed to get them to work, keep in mind that even if a mod isn't listed below, chances are that it still works fine with Balanced Waterfill installed. If you find an incompatibility, please don't hesitate to tell me about it in the Discussion tab of the mod page, I will try my best to get it working.


- [Cargo Ships](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/cargo-ships) - Required changes to collision masking to allow placing water ways and bridges on waterfill.

- [Beautiful Bridge Railway for Cargoships](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/beautiful_bridge_railway_Cargoships) - Needed some minor collision tweaks to get working on waterfill.

 - [Alien Biomes](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/alien-biomes) - Required some modification to ensure the new waterfill played well with the terrain from this mod.

- [Space Exploration](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/space-exploration) - Added a setting to allow or disallow placement of waterfill on dry planets from this mod.

- [RitnCharacters](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/RitnCharacters) - Was causing a crash with character mods loaded.

# Notes

 - The setting to configure the waterfill's collision properties only works in versions 1.1.51 and beyond, as it requires a special flag that was added in that version (If you are on a version before that, leave the setting on Normal)
 - Thanks to the Factorio discord community for answering my silly questions about Lua
 - Thanks to WUBE software, as all the sprites in the mod are constructed from art in the base game.
 - Please report any questions, suggestions, or bugs in the "Discussion" tab of the mod page.
